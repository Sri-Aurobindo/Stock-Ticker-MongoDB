# Stock-Ticker-MongoDB

- created and implemented two different designs for stock transaction data.

- First design (stockTransaction.js) support better performance for updating of the prices based on transactions – this is reflected in the “Recent” topline information about % changes in popular stocks, as well as the price per share listed right below “APPLE INC.”

- Second design (stockSummary.js) support better performance for the Summary info on the rest of the screen – the previous closing price, the opening price, the P/E and PEG ratios, the Analyst recommendation information on the right. You do not have to include every value here, but a representative subset so you can justify your design

- used bucket data pattern to aggregate the stock data.
